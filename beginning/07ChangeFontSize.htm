Using CSS class to style an element. Here I created a CSS class called green-text within the <style> tag. 
-->
<style>
	.green-text {
	  color: green;
	}
	<!--Font-size is controlled by CSS property, so inside the <style> tag I created an entry for p elements on line 9 and set the font-size to 14pixels.-->
	p {font-size: 14px;}
</style>

<!-- Class can be added to HTML. Here I apply a class to HTML element. Note that in CSS style element above, the class start with a period but not here in our HTML element.-->
<h2 class="green-text">MyPhotoApp</h2>

<!--CSS class can be use to style multiple elements. Here I apply the green-text class to the p element.-->
<p class="green-text">Spring in the air, colorful rainbow after rain, green horizon as far as your eyes can see.</p>

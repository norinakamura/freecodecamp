Using CSS class to style an element. Here I created a CSS class called green-text within the <style> tag. 
-->
<style>
	.green-text {
	  color: green;
	}
</style>

<!-- Class can be added to HTML. Here I apply a class to HTML element. Note that in CSS style element above, the class start with a period but not here in our HTML element.S-->
<h2 class="green-text">MyPhotoApp</h2>
